# Enterlab Mather

A small fun math tester for everybody, made for my kid who wants to improve in multiplication.

## Usage

`lein repl`

If not in namespace `enterlab.mather.core`, make sure to be:

```
(require 'enterlab.mater.core)
(in-ns 'enterlab.mather.core)
```

To start quizzing, you need to tell Mather who you are (just your first name), the smallest number you want to calculate with, the largest number, how many repetitions you want, and a language (currently :en for English and :da for Danish is supported):

`(quiz "luposlip" 4 13 10 :en)`

In this example I save (and read) statistics for the user called `luposlip`. The minimum number to multiply is `4`, maximum number is `13` and I have to do `10` repetitions.

The results are saved in a text file with the extension of `.mather`. In example `luposlip-results.mather`.

Personal performance is measured as seconds pr. correct answer, and grouped with other test runs with same minimum and maximum multiplier input.

## TODO

- other types of calculation (division, addition, subtraction)
- run directly from command line
